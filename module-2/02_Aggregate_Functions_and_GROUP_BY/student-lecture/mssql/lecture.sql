-- The average population of cities in each state in the USA ordered by state name

-- SUBQUERIES
-- Find the names of cities under a given government leader

-- Find the names of cities whose country they belong to has not declared independence yet

-- Additional samples
-- You may alias column and table names to be more descriptive

-- Alias can also be used to create shorthand references, such as "c" for city and "co" for country.

-- Ordering allows columns to be displayed in ascending order, or descending order (Look at Arlington)

-- While you can use TOP to limit the number of results returned by a query,
-- in SQL Server it is recommended to use OFFSET and FETCH if you want to get
-- "pages" of results. For instance, to get the first 10 rows in the city table
-- ordered by the name, you could use the following query.
-- (Skip 0 rows, and return only the first 10 rows from the sorted result set.)

SELECT TOP 10 name, lifeexpectancy
FROM country
ORDER BY lifeexpectancy DESC
OFFSET 20 ROWS FETCH
ORDER BY lifeexpectancy;

SELECT governmentform, COUNT(code) AS num_countries
FROM country 
GROUP BY governmentform
HAVING COUNT(code) > 10 -- Having restricts aggregrate functions
ORDER BY num_countries DESC;

-- average surface area of countries for each continent, round to 2 digits
SELECT continent, ROUND(AVG(surfacearea), 2) AS avg_surfacearea
FROM country
GROUP BY continent
ORDER BY avg_surfacearea DESC;

-- Most database platforms provide string functions that can be useful for working with string data. In addition to string functions, string concatenation is also usually supported, which allows us to build complete sentences if necessary.

-- Aggregate functions provide the ability to COUNT, SUM, and AVG, as well as determine MIN and MAX. Only returns a single row of value(s) unless used with GROUP BY.
-- Counts the number of rows in the city table

-- Also counts the number of rows in the city table

-- Gets the SUM of the population field in the city table, as well as
-- the AVG population, and a COUNT of the total number of rows.

-- Gets the MIN population and the MAX population from the city table.

-- Using a GROUP BY with aggregate functions allows us to summarize information for a specific column. For instance, we are able to determine the MIN and MAX population for each countrycode in the city table.
